# I-too-see: 
A repository of problems and discussion of means to address those problems.

The name of this project was inspired by the I2C protocol for communication between microchips. 
Their name comes from the acronym of "Inter Integrated Circuits": IIC. In maths, that can be written as IÂ²C, which becomes I2C as the name.
This inspired a pondering on what else the acronym might stand for...<br>
Ideas include:<br>
      			Integrated Individual Contributions.<br>
				Intelligent International Cooperation.<br>
				Impressively Inspirational Community.<br>
				And so on...
				
The name of this project comes from an expression of agreement and understanding. <br>
For example: <br>

"I see how this works, how about you?"

"I too see."
